I "worked" with Michael Brauringer. We spent the first few days
workingg together, and share similar or the same functions that follow:
shuffle
deal
add
remove
check
add book
----------
transfer
reset

Where Michael wrote the final version of those above the line, and I below.

The functions, although credited to one of us, were largely worked on in conjunction,
using cues from each others' work.
